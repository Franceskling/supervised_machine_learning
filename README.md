Precision and recall scores:
For oversampling, the precision and recall are both high. For undersampling, the recall is high for high_risk but low on low_end. For combination, the recall is high for both low_risk and high_risk. 

Balanced accuracy scores:
For both oversampling sets, the balanced accuracy is high (over 70%). The balanced accuracy for undersampling is also high (64%). The balanced accuracy for combination was also high (69%).

Final reccomendation: 
I reccomend the oversampling or combination models. They provide the most consistent results.
